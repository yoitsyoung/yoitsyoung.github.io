Inflation: one of the most elusive variables in Economics, redistributor of wealth, and arbiter of debt. Its definition is difficult to pin down. Does it refer to how much goods you can buy with 1 unit of currency (a purely monetary definition), or   Imagine a world with no inflation ALl societies want the sort of "good inflation": one that keeps people on the pedalling the wheels of the economy. There is no first-principles reason for why 2% is the common inflation target amongst central banks around the world. I very clearly remember Andrew Bailey (Governer of the BOE) admitting this in one of his talks at the LSE.

The reason why inflation so interesting to trade is because it is, by itself, a derivative. The CPI/RPI are all constructs, made of indices that.


For all its the trends in forward inflation and look strangely out of sync. But one must realize that as a short

There are, naturally, fewer sellers of inflation, but much more buyers of inflation protection

Suppose that you have receive 10 units of utility from consuming your first apple, then 9, then 8,... and so on until you are indifferent between consuming or not consuming your 10th apple. Assuming apples are costless, you would consume 10 apples in total. But let's approach this from a different perspective. Suppose you are unclear about your personal utility function, until you actually consume an apple. Suppose that your utility from the next apple you consume is a function of the amount of apples you have eaten. So your expected value's payoff function

# Yield Curve Control
When one talks of interest rates, the federal funds rate comes foremost to mind; which broadly is a target rate, because the true "rate" is measured by the rate at which banks lend to each other in markets. The Fed will not dictate this, but it can set upper and lower bounds on what the market rate will be. It does this by being a participant in the borrowing and lending of funds with banks itself, setting a floor and a ceiling on the federal funds rate through various instruments.

One can notice that the rate is extremely current.

It is not uncommon that there is an inflationary, and in one of the most explicit cases of forward guidance. The


# Econometric Opportunities
An interesting quirk about inflation indices is that it is purely an aggregate derivative of the true price changes, and that each consumer faces different degrees of inflation in his or her lives. Certain pension funds have a strict mandate to return above inflation rates for their depositories.
