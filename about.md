I'm Young. My full name is Ling Young Loon. I grew up in Singapore, and study Economics at LSE. Capital pulses through peoples, cities, and histories. That fascinates me. I trade and invest, and while I twiddle my thumbs for my theses to play out, I program. Code is now an inveterate extension of my self.

> Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them

This is my 2nd personal website. I was unsatisfied with the first as I couldn't write as expressively as I hoped. I missed sitting down and smithing my thoughts into words. To write is to be bold and be permenant. That is courage of the highest order.

For leisure, I scroll github. Or sometimes read Proust, amongst many others.

I dream a lot.

## Stuff I care about:
- Monetary aggregates & its plumbing
- Machine Learning v Econometrics
- Decentralization preceding the Singularity
