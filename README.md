### Motivation
I wanted to build my website with react.... but ended up with Jekyll. Jekyll's templating style is far more suited to static personal webpages. One doesn't need components when one is just indexing and displaying markdown files.


### Frameworks
I used the teXt theme for this, and did a bit of tweaks to the CSS to use Garamond as my main font. I also wanted the archive page to be my index page, so I changed the front matter of `index.html` to use the archive layout.

I faced the issue of wanting to link some of my posts, especially those I have written on substack or Mirror. I got around this by copying forward.html from this repository into the _layout section Now I just need to add a layout tag to the front matter so that it redirects to an outbound link. Neat.



### To dos
Prune the directory. And write more.

### Issues I faced
I couldn't use the sidebar navigation linkages.
